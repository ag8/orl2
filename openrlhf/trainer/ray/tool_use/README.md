# Tool Use for VLLM in OpenRLHF

This module adds tool use capabilities to VLLM in OpenRLHF, allowing models to execute Python code during generation.

## Overview

The implementation consists of:

1. **ToolExecutor**: A class that executes Python code in a sandbox and captures the output
2. **ToolLLMRayActor**: A modified version of LLMRayActor that supports tool use
3. **Test scripts**: Scripts to verify the implementation works correctly

## How It Works

When tool use is enabled:

1. The model generates text as usual
2. When Python code blocks are detected (enclosed in `<PYTHON></PYTHON>` tags), the code is executed
3. The output is injected back into the generation as `<PYTHON-OUTPUT></PYTHON-OUTPUT>` blocks
4. The model can then continue generating based on the output

## Testing

### Testing the Tool Executor

To test the tool executor independently:

```bash
python -m openrlhf.trainer.ray.tool_use.test_tool_use
```

This script runs several tests to verify that Python code execution works correctly.

### Testing the Tool-Enabled VLLM Engine

To test the tool-enabled VLLM engine:

```bash
python -m openrlhf.trainer.ray.tool_use.test_tool_engine --model <model_path> --tool-use-enabled
```

Replace `<model_path>` with the path to your model.

## Development Roadmap

1. âœ… Create a basic implementation that can execute Python code
2. âœ… Set up testing infrastructure
3. ðŸ”„ Implement tool use in the VLLM engine
4. ðŸ”„ Add support for streaming generation with tool use
5. ðŸ”„ Benchmark performance
6. ðŸ”„ Add support for other types of tools

## Implementation Details

### ToolExecutor

The `ToolExecutor` class:
- Extracts Python code blocks from text
- Executes the code in a restricted environment
- Captures stdout/stderr
- Returns the output to be injected back into the generation

### ToolLLMRayActor

The `ToolLLMRayActor` class:
- Extends the original `LLMRayActor` class
- Adds tool use capabilities
- Processes generated text to execute Python code
- Injects the output back into the generation

## Security Considerations

The `ToolExecutor` runs Python code in a restricted environment:
- Only a limited set of modules can be imported
- Dangerous operations are blocked
- Execution time is limited
- Output length is limited

## Future Work

- Add support for other types of tools (e.g., web search, API calls)
- Implement streaming generation with tool use
- Add support for interactive tools
- Improve error handling and security
